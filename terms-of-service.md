Welcome to the Vanta Interactive website ("Website"). Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Website operated by Vanta Interactive.

# 1. Agreement to Terms

By accessing or using the Website in any manner, including, but not limited to, visiting or browsing the Website, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of these Terms, then you may not access the Website.

# 2. Use License

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on Vanta Interactive's Website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:

 - Modify or copy the materials;
 - Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
 - Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on Vanta Interactive's Website;
 - Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or
 - Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.

This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by Vanta Interactive at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

# 3. Disclaimer

The materials on Vanta Interactive's Website are provided on an 'as is' basis. Vanta Interactive makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.

Further, Vanta Interactive does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its Website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

# 4. Limitations

In no event shall Vanta Interactive or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the materials on Vanta Interactive's Website, even if Vanta Interactive or a Vanta Interactive authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

# 6. Links

Vanta Interactive has not reviewed all of the sites linked to its Website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Vanta Interactive of the site. Use of any such linked website is at the user's own risk.

# 7. Modifications

Vanta Interactive may revise these Terms of Service for its Website at any time without notice. By using this Website you are agreeing to be bound by the then-current version of these Terms of Service.
