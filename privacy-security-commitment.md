At Vanta Interactive, we hold the utmost respect for our users' privacy and security. As privacy advocates, we recognize the importance of safeguarding personal data and ensuring a secure experience for all.

## Minimal Data Collection
Our websites, apps and games are meticulously crafted to collect as little data as possible. We adhere to strict principles of privacy by design, ensuring that only essential information is ever gathered, and always with the explicit consent of our users. All data accessible to a game is listed on the game page, with the reason as to why they're used. The same thing is done for permissions as well.

## Transparent Anti-Cheat and Anti-Tamper Solutions
Should the need arise to integrate anti-cheat or anti-tamper solutions into our games, we are committed to transparency and openness. Any such solutions will be developed in-house and released as open-source software. We believe in empowering our community by providing visibility into the code that safeguards fair play and protects against tampering.

## Invitation to Scrutinize
We extend an open invitation to anyone who wishes to examine our open-source code. Transparency is not just a value we uphold â€” it's a cornerstone of our commitment to accountability and trust. We encourage scrutiny and welcome feedback from our community to continually improve our security measures.

## Clear Communication Channels for Security Concerns
We have established clear communication channels for reporting security concerns or vulnerabilities. Users can reach out to our security team directly or visit our dedicated security domain for incident reporting.

## Commitment to Compliance and Transparency
We are committed to compliance with relevant privacy regulations, such as GDPR or CCPA, and to transparent communication with our users regarding any data collection practices or security incidents.

## Continuous Improvement
Our studio is dedicated to continuous improvement in privacy and security practices. We invite feedback from our users on how we can further enhance their privacy and security experience. If you have any questions, feedback, feel free to [tag us on Mastodon](https://techhub.social/@VantaInteractive) or [send us an e-mail](business.vantainteractive@gmail.com).
